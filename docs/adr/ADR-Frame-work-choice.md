## Title
Use Laravel

## Context
We need a frame work to support modularity and have built in features for supporting enhaced MySQL queries.

## Decision
We chose Laravel as framework for our project.

## Rationale
- Modularity
- Security (Built-in protections such as input validation, password hashing, and auth scaffolding)
- built-in testing

## Alternatives considered:
- Symphony(slower & harder to understand)
- Asp.net(for large applications)

## Consequences
- Easy to handle errors
- No Confusions
- clear code
