## Welcome to My Portfolio
 I am passionate about developing **secure, multifunctional, and user-friendly systems** that empower organizations to proactively combat modern threats. Areas of focus include:

- 🛡️ **Security Operations**: Implement secure user authentication, validate and sanitize data on both client and server sides, and manage sessions with robust controls to ensure data integrity and protection
- 🔧 **Backend Development**: Structure projects using modular design and object-oriented principles to create clean, reusable, and efficient code, enhancing maintainability and scalability

- 📚 **Documentation**: Develop comprehensive project documentation, including detailed plans, regular status reports, and well-structured code docstrings, to ensure clarity, accountability, and maintainability throughout the development lifecycle

### Current Focus

As I approach graduation in **May 2025**, I'm seeking opportunities in **Full Stack Software Engineering** roles where I can contribute to building robust  systems and continue learning from experienced software engineering professionals.
