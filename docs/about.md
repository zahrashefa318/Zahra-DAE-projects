# 🙋 About Me

I’m a **Full‑Stack Software Engineer** with a passion for crafting **open‑source tools** and **web applications**. I specialize in:

- **Back-end**: Laravel, Flask, MySQL  
- **Front-end**: JavaScript, HTML, CSS  

I enjoy building end-to-end solutions—from database architecture and API design to user interface and styling. Developing open-source projects and web apps energizes me, and I’m always eager to explore new ideas or contribute to meaningful projects.
