## 🧱 Entry Template 

- A RESTful API is an implementation of the REST (Representational State Transfer) architectural style. 
- It enables communication between client and server in a stateless manner, meaning each HTTP request is processed independently, without relying on prior interactions.
- State refers to any information a system remembers from previous operations—such as user interactions, data in memory, variables, or internal status. 
- If a system remembers or uses that data in future operations, it's stateful.
In REST (Representational State Transfer)
- •	Here, state typically refers to the state of a resource, not the application or server session.
- • The core idea: the server sends a representation of a resource’s state (like product details, account balance, etc.) to the client over HTTP . 
- •	The client can then use this representation to change its own application state—for example, displaying it or allowing updates.
- So in REST, state is tied to resources (e.g., a user's information), not to session memory or workflow continuity.
- In stateless(REST FULL) apps the state is saved in client but in statefull(RESTLESS) apps the state is saved in servers.
