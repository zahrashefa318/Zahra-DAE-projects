# ðŸ“˜ Learning Log

This folder tracks my journey of self-learning REST API technology and integrating it into my current project, FMFB. The content is split into three focused areas:

- **PLAN**: The roadmap of learning and integration.
- **DAILY_PROGRESS**: Ongoing logs of what Iâ€™ve learned and implemented each day.
- **mock_interview (technics)**: Technical interview-style questions and answers to reinforce understanding.
