## 🛠️ Step-by-Step Guide

Write the steps clearly and briefly. Use bullet points or numbers.

1. **Create or modify file `main.py`:**

    ```python
    from fastapi import FastAPI
    from loguru import logger

    app = FastAPI()

    @app.get("/health")
    def health_check():
        logger.info("Health check called")
        return {"status": "ok"}
    ```

2. **Run the app:**

    ```bash
    uvicorn main:app --reload
    ```

3. **Check logs in terminal:**
    ```
    2025-09-17 13:44:12.123 | INFO  | Health check called
    ```

## ✅ What You Should See

Describe the working result — terminal output, UI screenshot, etc.

> Example:
>
> -   Visiting `http://localhost:8000/health` returns `{"status": "ok"}`
> -   Terminal shows: `Health check called`

You can embed screenshots if helpful:

```markdown

## 💡 Pro Tips / Edge Cases

List 1–2 important reminders:

-   Make sure logging level is not filtered in production.
-   If deploying to cloud, structured logs may need to be sent to an external collector.
