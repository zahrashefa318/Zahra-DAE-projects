# ✅ Minimal REST API Rollout Plan (Completed Scope)

**Goal:** Ship a single, reliable REST **DELETE** endpoint for removing customers, with database integrity fixed so deletes work consistently.
---

**Rational:** REST is an architectural style, and one of its key constraints is statelessness: each request includes all the context the server needs, allowing any server behind a load balancer to handle it (no sticky sessions), so if one server is down another can serve the request without delay.

---

## 1) Scope (this phase)
- One endpoint: `DELETE /api/customerdestroy/{id}` → **204 No Content** on success; **404** if missing.
- Keep web routes/pages untouched.
- Stabilize DB foreign keys so deletes do not fail with `1451` errors.
- Lightweight docs + smoke tests only.

---

## 2) Deliverables
- **API route** in `routes/api.php` (`/api` prefix via Laravel’s `api` middleware group).
- **Controller + Service**: calls `LoanOfficerService::deleteCustomer($id)` (transactional); returns **204**.
- **DB integrity**: foreign keys updated to specify `ON DELETE CASCADE` or `ON DELETE SET NULL` where appropriate.
- **README** snippet with `curl` examples.

---

## 3) What we shipped
- Route:  
  `Route::delete('/customerdestroy/{id}', [\App\Http\Controllers\Api\LoanOfficerController::class, 'customerdestroy'])->name('customerdestroy');`
- Controller: returns **`response()->json(null, 204)`** (or `response()->noContent()` if no JsonResponse type-hint).
- Service: `Customer::findOrFail($id)->delete()` inside a transaction.
- Fixed FK blockers by **drop + re-add** with explicit **ON DELETE** behavior:
  - `business_info.customer_id` → **ON DELETE CASCADE**
  - `loan_guarantors.customer_id` → **ON DELETE CASCADE**
  - `loan_accounts.customer_id` → **ON DELETE CASCADE** *or* **SET NULL** (made column `NULL`able if using SET NULL; cleaned orphans)
  - `loan_applications.customer_id` → **ON DELETE CASCADE**

---

## 4) Known issues we resolved (and how)
- **500 type mismatch**: method hinted `JsonResponse` but returned `noContent()` (**Response**). Fixed by returning `response()->json(null, 204)` or removing the type-hint.
- **MySQL 1451 FK violations**: added `ON DELETE` actions (or deleted children first) on *every* FK referencing `customer_tbl(customer_id)`.
- **FK DDL errno 150/1215**: matched parent/child types (incl. `UNSIGNED`), ensured child `NULL`able for `SET NULL`, removed orphan rows, then re-added FK.
- **Workbench 1175 (safe updates)**: temporarily `SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES = 0` or used a key in `WHERE`.
- **Connection/metadata hiccups**: addressed 2003 (server not listening) and 2013 (lost connection while querying `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`) by checking service/port and using lighter metadata queries.

---

## 5) Verification
- **Smoke test:**
  ```bash
  curl -i -X DELETE "http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/customerdestroy/111" -H "Accept: application/json"
