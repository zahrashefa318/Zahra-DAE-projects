# About Me

My name is Zahra Shefa. I hold a **bachelor’s degree in Computer Science**.

Since childhood, I have been fascinated by mathematical subjects and have always enjoyed solving logical problems. When I entered university, I discovered software engineering, which naturally aligned with my interests. It felt like a hobby to bring ideas to life through code—but over time, it has become my life’s goal. In this field, we have the power to create positive, large-scale change for people around the world.

So far, I have created **five repositories**. I pride myself on being creative and pioneering, but that doesn’t mean I dismiss others’ suggestions. I am a **quick learner**. To prove it: for my most recent project, I developed a fully functional, automated loan management system using **Laravel**, **MySQL**, and **React**—despite starting with zero knowledge of Laravel and React, and only minimal MySQL experience.

Currently, I am working on building a “table maker” API, accessible from different origins, which will serve as a tool for creating tables dynamically. My goal is to continually improve my skills, and I am passionate about learning new technologies.
